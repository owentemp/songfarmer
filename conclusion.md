## **Conclusion**

In summary, I believe that cultivating songwriting habits, collecting seeds, and moving back and forth from a FLOW mode to an EDIT mode while composing is how songs are written.

I believe that you will write **more songs** as you:

*   Strengthen songwriting habits and increase the number of song ideas you get from songwriting routines

*   Separate FLOW mode composing from EDIT mode composing to prevent writer’s block and getting stuck

*   Gain skill to FLOW more freely

I believe that you will write **better songs** as you:

*   Design songs to meet your goals

*   Study what makes for “sticky” or memorable songs

*   Gain skill to EDIT and improve early drafts of lyrics

*   Gain musical skill with your instrument

*   Learn from listening and performing how to use melodies and grooves effectively

I believe we can make something with our days. So go ahead and make something.
